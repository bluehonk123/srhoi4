1.9.3 Version of SR
Built off of horst
Scripted wars pre danzig
Pre made generals
Rebalanced industries and technology around having a war of attrition
-Tanks and planes are more expensive
-Cas is more powerful, and get shot down less by aa
- Artillery, anti-tank and aa are cheaper
-Anti-tank has lots of hard attack but little piercing, lose the battle against tanks but win the ic war
-Anti-air is weaker, consider putting in line aa (which is 2 combat width)
-Infantry equipment has reduced stats, which are spread across at, arty and aa, Pure infantry divisions are not as
viable
Barbarossa rebalanced so that soviets get pushed significantly in the opening months, but turn the tide over time

Economy Laws are changed:
Early Mob: is locked behind Germany doing Rhineland for democratic/non-aligned nations
Partial Mob: is locked behind Germany doing Anschluss for democratic/non-aligned nations, available from the start for Fascist and Communist nations
War economy: is locked for allies until they are at war, it unlocks at Anschluss for Communist/Fascist nations
Total Mob locked until at war and June 1941

Country Specific Changes:

USA: Gets large bonuses for building civs, Giant Wakes locked behind germany doing danzig or war, build civs!

Soviets: Get a large purge debuff at the start of barbarossa, which steadily decreases over time. Expect to get pushed pretty far in opening months but eventually stop the blitzkrieg. You unlock better generals as the war rages on, which are as good or even better than the Axis. Greatly increased industry and production.
